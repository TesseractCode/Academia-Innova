# Academia-Innova & PITECH PLUS: AI/ eLearning Platform Development
## Project Overview
- Develop an e-learning platform that enables the evaluation of technical skills for software development. The platform will propose a process to improve competencies in various sections. It aims to serve as a virtual mentor, guiding users towards more efficient learning and suggesting competence improvements based on assessments.

### Features:
- Evaluation Complexity: Questions in the assessments will have varying difficulty levels defined by participants.
- Categorical Assessments: Questions will cover different categories specific to software development (at least 10 categories required).
- Personalized Feedback: After each assessment, based on the difficulty and sections evaluated, the user will receive a summary of current knowledge and suggestions for career progression.
### Requirements:
- The platform should contain various sections/criteria for evaluation, along with specific questions for these criteria at different difficulty levels (adding/editing/removing of questions/categories/difficulty levels remains within participants' discretion).
### Virtual Mentor Role:
- Generate evaluations based on the above criteria.
- Optimize the learning process by suggesting intelligent solutions and generating evaluations with suitable difficulty levels.
- Objectively assess and suggest areas for improvement.
### Judging Criteria (Scoring up to 100 points):
- Learning Path Algorithm: 40 points
- Evaluation Algorithm: 30 points
- Application Accessibility: Web or desktop: 20 points
- Solution Argumentation: 10 points
